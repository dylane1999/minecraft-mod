## story
I created all the mods in this project, in total there are three mods:
1. Grenade Mod - A mod that allows you to throw exploding grenades projectiles 
2. Nuke Mod - A mod that creates a nuke block that explodes with about 40x the power of a TNT block
3. Lightsaber Mod - a lightsaber sword that has awesome sound effects when you fight mobs with it.
